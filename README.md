DESCRIPTION:

Tools Used:
Pandas (Python):
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. In this project, it is used to read data from a CSV file and perform group-wise aggregation. Specifically, the library helps to group the dataset by departments and calculate the average salary and experience. Its DataFrame structure provides an efficient way to filter, analyze, and transform the data for report generation.

FPDF (Python):
FPDF is a Python library used to create PDF documents easily. In this project, FPDF is used to generate a structured and professional-looking report based on the analyzed data. It allows customization of fonts, cell formatting, table structures, and layout, making it ideal for producing formal documents such as summaries, invoices, or department reports.

CSV File (data.csv):
The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is used as the source of the dataset. It contains structured data with fields like Department, Salary, and Experience. The file format is simple and readable, and it is compatible with many data tools. In this project, the data in the CSV file is loaded using pandas for further processing.
